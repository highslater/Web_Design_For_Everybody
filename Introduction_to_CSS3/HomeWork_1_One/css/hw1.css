/*
You will review each submission based on whether each objective/style is achieved or not, and at what level.  (For instance, did they put in background-color and if so, did they use hexadecimal or rgb.)
Specifically, you will evaluate submissions by answering the following questions: 
Is the header styled with a new background color?
Is the h1 heading styled?
Is the h2 heading styled?
Is the section styled with a new background color?
Are the links styled?
Are the images gone? They shouldnâ€™t be there.
