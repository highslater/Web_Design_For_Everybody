In this assignment you will take my HTML code and create a single html file called hw1.css.  It should style the page following the guidelines provided.  You can see an example final product at http://www.intro-webdesign.com/CSS/final/teams.jpg

Video notes:

    table:
    
        font: multiple families, size, weight, and line-height.
        width: do not take up the entire space.
        margin: center the table.
        
    table heading:
    
        change the background color and use gradient (browser prefix).
        add a border.
            round only the top two corners.
            make bottom border thicker.
        add at least one other property.
        
    table rows:
        
        set opacity to 0.8.
        left-align the first column, center the other two.
        set :hover to opacity of 1. (font:hover)
        
    td:
        
        change padding, font-color, background color, border radius to 2px.
        use text-shadow.
    
    specify preffered screen size.
    
        
    

Steps:

1) The table should be styled using at least four properties 

2) The table headings should have a border, background color, and at least one other image 

3) Style the table so that the text in the first column is left-aligned and the text in the other two columns is centered 

4) Set the opacity of the table rows to a value between .6 and .8 (make sure it is still visible) 

5) Change the opacity of a row when it is hovered over 

6) The table elements <td> should be styled using at least four properties


Specifically, you will evaluate submissions by answering the following questions: 
Is the table element styled?
Are the table headings properly styled?
Are ONLY the corners of the table styled?
Does the opacity of a table row change when it is hovered over?
Are the table elements styled?
